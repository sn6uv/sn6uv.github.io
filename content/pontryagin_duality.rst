Topological groups
------------------
A topological groups is what one might expect, a group $G$ equipped with a topology.
We ask that the topology is nice with respect to the group structure.
Namely, we require that the binary operation on the group $G \times G \to G$, and the inverse $G \to G$ are continuous.

One simple group is the circle group $\mathbb{T} = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1\}$ equipped with multiplication.
To make this a topological group this group can be equipped with the standard topology coming from $\mathbb{C}$.
Complex multiplication and inverses are clearly continuous on $\mathbb{T}$.
As we will soon see, this group turns out play a central role in Pontryagin duality.
